# Social Network API

## Description

The Social Network API is a web application that serves as the backend for a social network website. The purpose of this project is to provide a scalable API solution for a social networking platform, allowing users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend list. The API is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

This project helped me gain valuable experience in building APIs using a NoSQL database like MongoDB, handling complex relationships between users, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists.

## Installation

To set up the Social Network API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine.

## Usage

To use the Social Network API, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine.
2. Update the database connection settings in the `.env` file with your MongoDB credentials.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Run `npm start` to start the application.
5. Use API testing tools like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to interact with the API.

The application provides API routes for managing users, thoughts, reactions, and friend lists. You can use the available endpoints to create, read, update, and delete data in the social network database. Refer to the API documentation or explore the code to understand the available routes and their functionality.
